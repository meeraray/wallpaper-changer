# wallpaper-changer
Changes desktop wallpaper every sunrise and sunset

To import the required dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Run **UI.py** to set up the images you want to use and then **wallpaper.pyw** to get it working.

To run on startup, create a shortcut to wallpaper.pyw and add it do your system's startup folder. This varies based on system.
Currently this only works on Windows. I'm working on adding support for MAC and making installation easier for non-devs.
