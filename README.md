# Wallpaper Changer

 [**Install**](wallpaper-changer-setup.exe)

Changes desktop wallpaper every sunrise and sunset, so there's one shown at night and one shown in the daytime. Sunset and sunrise change slightly each day as the days get longer in the summer and shorter in the winter. So, it depends on both the date and where you are in the world. This app accounts for this. Install it by downloading and running the [installer](wallpaper-changer-setup.exe). 

Currently this only works on Windows. I'm working on adding support for MAC and making installation easier for non-devs.


### For developers:
To import the required dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Run **UI.py** to set up the images you want to use and then **wallpaper.py** to get it working.
