# Wallpaper Changer

 [**Install**](wallpaper-changer-setup.exe)

Changes desktop wallpaper every sunrise and sunset, so there's one shown at night and one shown in the daytime. It changes exactly during sunrise and sunset in your specific location. Install it by downloading and running the [installer](wallpaper-changer-setup.exe). 

Currently this only works on Windows. I'm working on adding support for MAC and making installation easier for non-devs.


### For developers:
To import the required dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Run **UI.py** to set up the images you want to use and then **wallpaper.py** to get it working.
